This repo contains:
1- Programs related to my research in Automated Speech Recognition. Most of these files are (will be) in Python. Some others
	are, or will be, in Matlab.
2- Programs that I create to teach C.
3- Programs solving the exercises of the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas Cormen and others. These programs are
	written in C.
